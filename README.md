# Karma
Karma is an implementation of a decision-making engine, based on the probabilistic classification provided by the Bayesian theorem. Here we are using a NAÏVE-BAYES classifier, however any other classifier can be used such as TREE AUGMENTED NAÏVE-BAYES, BN AUGMENTED NAÏVE-BAYES, Averaged One-Dependence Estimators or other non BAYES classifiers and can be expanded to use any ML algorithm.
